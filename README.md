## Project Prompt

Project 1 is an individual project that will focus on the object-oriented principles. The project needs to implement object oriented principles and should be interactive so that the user can play around with it. The code base needs to be entirely composed of objects (at least 5 should be in your creation) and should be called from the command line as a .py file so it can be easily ported to to a production scenario.

## Storyline

You are a small-time drug dealer wanting to pivot in your profession and become a data scientist. You apply to UC Berkeley's prestigious MIDS prorgam and, because of your questionable past, the acceptance committee decides to let you in as the very last accepted student on one condition: you have to pay your full $75,000 tuition up front! It's July 1st, 2021 and you have until August 1st (30 days) to come up with the cash. Wtih only $2,000 to your name and no hope of getting student loans, you decide to do what you do best: Slangin'! But hurry! You still owe the loan shark $5,500 and he charges 10% interest per day.

## Game Play

Start the game from command prompt: python Millennial_Into_Drugs_Sales.py.

Choose "y" or "n" if you want to read instructions and storyline.

Remember the range of drug prices -- you're going to need them as you play the game.

The HUD (Heads up Display) shows you your status. Pay close attention to the date, your debt (to the loan shark), and the market prices. These prices fluctuate every time you move from one neighborhood to another.

In order to visit the loan shark to pay off your debt, visit your stash (where you keep your drugs safe), or visit the bank (to keep your money safe), you <em>must</em> be in The Bronx. No other neighborhood has these options.

There are random chance events that occur. The probability of them happening is low, but you may lose your money or drugs during these events based on random chance. However, positive money outcomes are higher when dollar amounts for transactions (buying and selling drugs) are lower. The higher the transaction amount, the more money you might lose. The same is true for drugs. When you buy lower-cost drugs, having 1 or 3 isn't a big deal. However, when buying Cocaine, losing 1 or 3 is a big deal.

Remember to buy low and sell high!

The menu is intuitive so choose to your own adventure to play the game!

## Functionality That Didn't Make it Into This Version

1. Random event that happens whenever you move from neighborhood to neighborhood: I had intented to have run-ins with muggers (lose money and/or, hence the need to stash money and drugs into the bank and stash in The Bronx)
2. Buying guns and getting into gun fights wtih drug dealers: I had intended to have a game within the game where the Player has the option to buy guns and get into a gun fight with a drug dealer (whoever has more guns wins). If the Player wins the gun fight, then they receive the spoils of drugs. If the Player loses, they lose all their drugs and money.
