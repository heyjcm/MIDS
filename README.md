# MIDS
You are a small-time drug dealer wanting to pivot in your profession and become a data scientist. You apply to UC Berkeley's prestigious MIDS prorgam and, because of your questionable past, the acceptance committee decides to let you in as the very last accepted student on one condition: you have to pay your full $75,000 tuition up front! It's July 1st, 2021 and you have until August 1st (30 days) to come up with the cash. Wtih only $2,000 to your name and no hope of getting student loans, you decide to do what you do best: Slangin'! But hurry! You still owe the loan shark $5,500 and he charges 10% interest per day.
